Welcome to my website! I'm a policy officer at the Ministry of Finance with a focus on long-term care. My research interests are household finance, financial history and European financial integration. 

In [my PhD](http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/385176) I conducted a comparative case study of the financial service provision to French and Dutch households from 1960 until today. I completed research visits to the Banque de France and De Nederlandsche Bank, and did consultancy work at the European Central Bank.  

I'm currently working on household financial fragility during the Great Depression and the evolution of household wealth between 1860 and today.

My full CV is available [here](files/CV_vanderValk.pdf).
